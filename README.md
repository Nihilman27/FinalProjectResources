# Final Project Resources

I've split the resources for the final project into their own repository to simplify working with the repository containing your code.

## Pygame

[Pygame](http://pygame.org) is a module that allows you to create visuals and work with keyboard and mouse inputs to create interactive programs. You may find [getting started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) and the [documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) helpful.

## Pyglet

[Pyglet](https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home) is another module that allows you to create visuals and work with keyboard and mouse inputs. I find it a little easier to work with than Pygame, but you may feel otherwise. It's less popular than Pygame and so there aren't quite as many resources out there as there are for Pygame. You may find the [documentation](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.3-maintenance/index.html) helpful.

## Pymunk

[Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) is a 2D physics engine. If you want to have objects interacting with each other in physical space (and I know a few of you were considering that), this will do a lot of the math for you. You can combine it with Pygame or Pyglet.
